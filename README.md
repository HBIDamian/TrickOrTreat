# TrickOrTreat
This is a simple plugin that allows you to trick or treat in your server during Halloween. For far too long, Halloween has been a holiday that has been neglecting the whole "trick" part of the phrase "trick or treat". This plugin aims to change that by adding a random chance of getting a trick instead of a treat. 

## Command
- `/trickortreat` - Trick or treat in your server.

## Permissions
- `trickortreat.command` - Permission to use the `/trickortreat` command.

## Soft Dependencies
 - [lmao](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/lmao) - Used for the random troll-like behaviour. 
 The plugin can be used without it, but only with the VanillaEffects behaviours.

## Configuration
```yaml
# As of the time of writing, the plugin is not really configurable.
# The only thing you can change is the cooldown for the command.
cooldown: 60
```
